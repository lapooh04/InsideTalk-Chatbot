# InsideTalk Chatbot

InsideTalk is a unique chatbot application inspired by the concept of *Inside Out*, designed to help users navigate their emotions through empathetic dialogue. By recognizing and responding to the user's chosen emotions, the chatbot fosters a deeper understanding of feelings and encourages healthy emotional expression.

## Concept and Theme

InsideTalk draws inspiration from the animated film *Inside Out*, where emotions play a crucial role in guiding the protagonist’s experiences. Similarly, this chatbot utilizes a range of emotions—such as happiness, sadness, fear, and disgust—to engage users in meaningful conversations. Each emotion serves as a distinct character, providing tailored responses that reflect the complexities of human feelings.

This innovative approach allows users to explore their emotional landscapes, enabling them to articulate their feelings more clearly and seek guidance in challenging situations.
